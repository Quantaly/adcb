# AngularDart Component Bootstrap

A package for generating the minimum necessary code for an AngularDart component.

It writes `component_name.dart`, `component_name.html`, and `component_name.scss` into `lib/src/components/component_name` by default.

Maybe at some point in the future I'll add a configuration file.
